## What is the Little Man Computer (LMC)?

The Little Man Computer is a simplified model of a computer, created for educational purposes. It is a great tool for understanding how computers execute programs at the machine level. The LMC has an assembly language with a small set of instructions, which makes it a perfect starting point for beginners.

## Programs in this Repository

Each file in this repository is an individual LMC program that demonstrates a specific algorithm or task. Here are some of the included programs:

- `countdown.asm`: A program that takes an input number and counts down to zero.
- `find_max.asm`: A program that compares two numbers and displays the greater one.
- `addition.asm`: A simple program that adds two numbers together.
- More programs will be added over time.

## How to Use These Programs

To run these programs, you will need an LMC simulator. You can find various simulators online. Here are the general steps to use these programs with a simulator:

1. Open the online [LMC - CPU Simulator](https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc "LMC Homepage").
2. Copy the code from the file.
3. Paste it into the code input area of the simulator.
4. Click LOAD.
5. Click RUN.
